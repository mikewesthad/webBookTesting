<h2 id="tcp-vs-udp">TCP vs UDP</h2>
<p>TCP and UDP are 2 of the most used protocols to comunicate through a network. Indeed TCP is so common that the suite of protocols on which internet is based is usually called TCP/IP. The network protocols are classified in layers by something called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model" target="_blank">OSI model</a> TCP and UDP belong to layer 4, the transport layer, and are usually the most used in OF along with protocols from layer 7, the application protocol, like HTTP, FTP or OSC that actually work on top of the other layers, for example HTTP and FTP on top of TCP and OSC usually on top of UDP.</p>
<h3 id="tcp">TCP</h3>
<p><strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong>, is without doubt the most used network protocol on the Internet, it is a protocol based on a connection, stream based and resistant to errors, package reordering and package lose. Let's see what all that means.</p>
<p>To understand all that we might need to know a bit about how a TCP/IP network works. First of all we need to know that when we send something it's usually divided in packages, each segment of the network might support a different package size so it might subdivide our packages into smaller packages. A package is just a segment of the information we are trying to send plus some headers depending on the protocol we are using. This division in packages is used among other things so it's easier to recover from errors. For example if we are sending a file and we sent it in one go, if some parts of it get corrupted we'll need to resend the full file again. Dividing it in packages and adding some headers to them allows us to detect errors per package so we only need to resend the corrupted packages instead of the whole thing.</p>
<p>When we send a package from one computer to another, even with a connection based protocol like TCP, there's no way of knowing in advance which path it's going to arrive through. On the Internet there's several paths to arrive from one point to another and packages go through whatever path is more optimal at the moment they are sent. But that path might no longer be the ideal path some milliseconds later, so the next package could go through a different route and even arrive before than packages that were sent before.</p>
<p>Another problem is that packages might get corrupted on their way to the destination computer, for example, because of electrical noise in some of the cables.</p>
<p>With all that let's say we send packages ABCD in that order, it might be that at the other end we get something like GCB: package A got corrupted and turned into G, packages B and C arrived ok but in the wrong order, and package D was totally lost.</p>
<p>TCP is able to solve all of those problems. when TCP sends packages it numbers them so that they can be correctly ordered when the other computer recieves them. It also adds something called a CRC to each package that allows the other computer to know if that package is corrupt.</p>
<p>When the destination receives a package and that package is correct, it sends a confirmation, also called an ACK. If after some time the sender hasn't received that confirmation, it sends the package again. Whic solves the problem of corrupted and lost packages.</p>
<p>This ACKs also allows to regulate the speed with which packages are sent so if the clienthas less bandwith than the server, the server can slow down sending packages till it arrives to the speed at which the client can receive them</p>
<p>As we see, using a TCP connection ensures that everything we send is received correctly on the other side.</p>
<p>So why not just always use TCP? Well TCP has some limitations, for example TCP is connection oriented, that means that in order to communicate with another machine we need to open a connection explicitly to that machine and that machine only.</p>
<p>TCP is also stream oriented. That means that we cannot send individual messages and expect them to arrive in one piece, they will arrive eventually but not exactly as we sent them. For example if we send something like:</p>
<pre><code>    "Hello world!! this is an openFrameworks network message"</code></pre>
<p>On the other side, the application using TCP, we may receive it like:</p>
<pre><code>    "Hello w"
    "orld!"
    "!this is a"
    "n openFr"
    "ameworks ne"
    "twork mess"
    "age"</code></pre>
<p>We can't even be sure of which size those packages are going to have. There's tricks to send full messages, like adding a delimiter to them, for example openFrameworks when doing:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp">tcpClient.send(<span class="st">"Hello world!! this is an openFrameworks network message"</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Internally is sending:</p>
<pre><code>    "Hello world!! this is an openFrameworks network message[/TCP]\0"</code></pre>
<p>The last <code>\0</code> is actually added for compatibility reasons with old versions of flash! The <code>[\TCP]</code> allows the other side to read the stream until it receives the full message. So when you use:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp">string message = tcpServer.receive();</code></pre>
<p>Internally ofxTCPCLient/Server will read the stream, keep the partial messages in memory, and wait until it gets the delimiter before returning a full message. This is done transparently, but if you are interfacing with some other protocol coming from a non OF application you might need to do this your self by using <code>sendRaw()</code> <code>sendRawMsg()</code> <code>receiveRaw()</code> and <code>receiveRawMsg()</code> which don't send or expect a terminator.</p>
<p>If the protocol you are working with uses TCP and a delimiter, chances are you might be able to use this same trick by using:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp">tcpClient.setMessageDelimiter(myDelimiter);</code></pre>
<p>Something important that you might know already: in order to connect applications through a TCP/IP transport network protocol, you usually need, an IP address and a port, the IP address is specific to each machine, the port to each application. So with an IP/port pair we can define an application running in a specific address along all Internet, almost. For example an application that is running a web server usually runs on port 80, if the machine is being executed in has the IP 15.6.8.2, 15.6.8.2:80 defines that web server among any other application running in any other machine in all the Internet. So if we want to connect two machines, usually all we need to know is the IP and port of the application running in the server and use it in the client to connect ot it.</p>
<p>There's an exception though. In most internal networks, like your home network for example, there's a router that connects the machines in that network to the Internet. These routers usually do something called NAT: Network Address Translation. NAT was invented because the IPv4 protocol has a limited number of IP addresses. Internally, the network uses a reserved range of addresses: 192.168.x.x/24 or 10.x.x.x/32, which are addresses that won't be found directly on the internet. When we try to connect to an external address it acts as a kind of proxy between your computer and the server that we want to connect. The router has it's own external address, and when it receives a response it translates the address and port in which it has received it to an internal one, the one from our computer and sends the packages back to us.</p>
<p>While this is really practical, it means that if we have 2 computers behind NAT routers, it's imposible to open a connection between them (in principle) . There's ways to configure a router to send any package sent to a specific port to the same internal address. There's also libraries like <a href="https://github.com/arturoc/ofxNice" target="_blank">ofxNice</a> that allow you to do NAT transversal, but that will only work using UDP.</p>
<h3 id="udp">UDP</h3>
<p>UDP or <strong>User Datagram Protocol</strong>, is a non-connection datagram oriented, non error resistant protocol. It is more or less the total opposite to TCP. We don't need to establish a connection, instead we just send messages to a specific address and port. As long as there's a process listening in that machine and that port it will receive the message.</p>
<p>Datagram oriented means that whatever we send, that fits in the package size supported by the network, by all the subnetworks in the path from one computer to another, will arrive in one piece on the other side. In openFrameworks, if we do:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp">string message = <span class="st">"Hello world!! this is an openFrameworks network message"</span>;
udpManager.SendAll(message, message.size());</code></pre>
<p>The other side will receive that message in one piece. That is, if it receives it at all.</p>
<p>As we've said before, UDP is not resistant to errors so the package may not arrive. It may get corrupted and there's no way to recover it. If we send several packages they may arrive in a different order then they were sent. UDP also doesn't adjust for bandwidth, so if one side is sending faster than what the other side can receive, or even if it fills the local buffers while sending, some packages will get lost. What's worse, we won't receive any advice that they got lost, nor in the sender nor in the receiver.</p>
<p>UDP might seem not useful but it has some advantages. Sometimes, we don't mind some packages being lost. For example, if we are sending a package every few frames with the state of our application we don't mind if sometimes we don't receive one of them. It's also really hard to loose a package on a local network, but if you need total reliability don't trust UDP, just use TCP.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of UDP come from the fact that is connectionless. That means, among other things, that we can broadcast messages to all of the computers in the local network using a broadcast address. To calculate the broadcast address we need to know the IP address of the machine from where we are sending and the subnetwork mask by doing a bit xor on them you get the broadcast address. For example, if the IP address of our machine is 192.168.0.3, and our network mask is 255.255.255.0, the broadcast address will be 192.168.0.255. We can also use multicast if we are working across networks although that's more difficult to setup. We can reuse ports, so we can have more than one process in the same machine using the same port, or use the same port to send and receive...</p>
<p>UDP, as we mentioned before, allows us to do NAT transversal using some clever tricks although is not something that can be done with raw UDP and requires a third party library.</p>
<p>A case where UDP might be preferable over TCP is in very time critical applications, you might have heard that UDP is faster than TCP. That is not exactly true, at least is not that fast to make much difference. The real difference is that when using TCP, if a package gets corrupted or lost the next messages won't get delivered to the application until the lost one is resent so that might introduce a slight delay. In most applications that delay is not noticeable but in some very time critical applications we might prefer to loose some packages than having to wait for them to be resnet. We are usually talking of milliseconds here so as we've said it is usually not a problem.</p>
<p>Another possibility is implementing part of the error recovery in TCP while using UDP, for example we might not mind loosing some packages or getting some of them corrupt but we care about the order in which they arrive, in those cases we can implement package reordering in UDP simply by using a sequence number in each messsage and reorder the packages in the destination by having a buffer so we can wait a little before actually processing a message to see if any other message thath might arrive later needs to be processed before.</p>
<p>In general use TCP if you need your messages to arrive no matter what, when loosing even one package might be critical and UDP if you need some of the most advanced uses like broadcasting, multicasting, NAT transversal, or when waiting for lost packages to be resent, even a few milliseconds, might make be critical for the application while loosing some packages is ok.</p>
<h2 id="osc">OSC</h2>
<p>OSC is an application level protocol. It is of a higher level than UDP or TCP, and it's main characteristic is that it allows to send types like int, float, string... without worrying about the underlying architecture of the sender and receiving machine. It's usually based on UDP so it has some of the same problems.</p>
<p>It's usage in openFrameworks is really simple, so just check the examples in the examples/addons folder to know how it works.</p>
<p>Another advantage of using OSC is that there's lots of commercial and open source projects that support OSC. Using OSC you might be able to easily control some other software or receive results from it, for example you can have a Pure Data patch to generate audio and control it's parameters from openFrameworks by sending OSC messages to it.</p>
<p>As well as OSC there's other application level protocols for specific applications and it's usually easier to use those than trying to use transport protocols like TCP or UDP. For example streaming video is a really complex problem to solve but there's protocols like RTP that already solve or at least mitigate all the complications that it involves so using a library that implements RTP will be easier than trying to send video directly using TCP or UDP.</p>
